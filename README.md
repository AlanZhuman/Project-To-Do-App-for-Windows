Hello everyone who will see that repo!
My name is Alan and I started to learn Git 26.04.2024, so this repo will be for one project, and exactly a todo list or notes app on Python!
Im not sure which Python modules I gonna use, but I will edit this readme in future anyway.

UPD: I did a simple UI and the first realisation of creating a notes but yet not deleting, fullscreen is also available with f11 and ESC to quit from Fullscreen mode. I think about a little database of coordinates of instances to delete and to move notes but I have no Idea how to do that, cuz I tried to delete notes with a button on them but that works only for deleting, not moving them and this is kinda crutch
