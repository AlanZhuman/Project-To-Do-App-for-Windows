Hello everyone who will see that repo!
My name is Alan and I started to learn Git 26.04.2024, so this repo will be for one project, and exactly a todo list or notes app on Python!
Im not sure which Python modules I gonna use, but I will edit this readme in future anyway.

UPD: I updated and recreated a piece of code for better logic, so differents is: Colors of UI were changed, better logic of creating/deleting notes. Next goal is moving notes after deleting old one, even in center or begin
